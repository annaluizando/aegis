# Aegis: An AI-Powered Pipeline Security Scanner

Aegis is a command-line tool that uses AI to scan your project and provide intelligent security recommendations for your CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure configurations. It analyzes your project's context and leverages a powerful language model to deliver tailored, expert-level advice.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Context-Aware Scanning:** Automatically scans your project for key infrastructure and dependency files, including:
  - `package.json`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows`)

- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Gathers all the contextual information from your project and sends it to an AI model, which acts as a senior security engineer to provide you with:
  - **Tailored Recommendations:** Security advice that is specific to your project's dependencies and infrastructure.
  - **Performance Considerations:** Suggestions that balance security with pipeline performance and execution time.
  - **Actionable Snippets:** Ready-to-use code snippets for CI/CD and Dockerfile configurations.

## ðŸ§° Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/annaluizando/aegis.git
    cd aegis
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Compile the TypeScript code:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  Link the package to make the command available globally:
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```

5.  Set up your environment:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## ðŸš€ Usage

There are two ways to run Aegis:

1.  **Directly:** Scan a specific project by providing its path.
    ```bash
    aegis /path/to/your/project
    ```

2.  **Interactively:** If you are already inside your project's directory, simply run the command without any arguments.
    ```bash
    aegis
    ```
    This will start an interactive session where you can choose to scan the current directory or configure your OpenAI API key.

The tool will then output the AI's analysis and recommendations to the console.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
